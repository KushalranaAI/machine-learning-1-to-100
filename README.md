## 📝 Folder Descriptions

### 1️⃣ **Data\_collection/**

Scripts & tools to collect raw data from various sources:

* **Web\_scraping/**: Scrapers using `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `requests`.
* **APIs/**: Sample code to fetch data from REST APIs (handling auth, pagination).

✔️ Helps users learn how to ingest data programmatically.

---

### 2️⃣ **Data\_Preprocessing/**

Techniques to clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling:

* **Data\_cleaning/**: Scripts for handling missing values, fixing outliers, cleaning text.
* **Data\_transformation/**: Code for scaling, encoding, transforming features.
* **Data\_splitting/**: Code to split data for train-test-validation pipelines.

✔️ Ensures learners understand real-world messy data preparation.

---

### 3️⃣ **Feature\_engineering/**

Learn how to create and optimize features:

* **Feature\_creation/**: Examples of crafting new features from raw data.
* **Feature\_selection/**: Techniques to reduce features (correlation, importance, RFE).
* **Dimensionality\_reduction/**: PCA, LDA implementations.

✔️ Includes both coding & explanation of feature importance for model performance.

---

### 4️⃣ **Model\_preparation\_practices/**
